	<div class="wrap">Hello!<br/><br/>I am Chaitra. I have recently developed an interest in Web-development. Ahh!! Web-Developer!! Sounds cool right.. I think that's what interested me into it. Not to mention this subject is highly addictive. I am a fun loving girl. I love hanging out with friends...I enjoy walking down the road when its drizzling...The cozy evening goes well with a cup of coffee...I love to paint and have done a few paintings. My friends tell me that I am a museum-piece... Well you'll know it if you spend time with me... :) <br/><br/>I was born in Kumta, a small town in Uttara Kannada District of Karnataka State. I was brought up in Karwar... This place is very close to Goa! Yeah that's one of my favourite holiday spot... I am passionate about so many things.. and my recently developed passion for Web releted stuffs is amazing.. M lovin' it :) I would like to put more effort into this field and I am hoping that one day I will become a successfull Web Developer..! :) </div>
